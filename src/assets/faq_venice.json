    "question": "Who qualifies for the VVV user airdrop?",
    "answer": "There are two categories of airdrop recipients:  Venice users, and crypto community protocol users. Venice Users: Your airdrop is based on the points you earned in the app, as of Dec 31 2024. If you had at least 25 points, and you were active in the app later than Oct 1 2024, you received some portion of tokens (the more points you had, the higher the amount of VVV tokens you earned). Note: While all users could accumulate points, if you wish to claim the airdrop, you must upgrade to be a Pro user. 25 million VVV tokens (25% of total supply) were allocated to Venice users (thank you for pioneering with us!) Crypto Protocol Users: 25 million VVV tokens (25% of total supply) were allocated for crypto and AI community protocols and developers, including: + VIRTUALS, AERO, DEGEN, AIXBT, GAME, LUNA, VADER, CLANKER, MOR, FOX + Roughly 200 registered Coinbase Agentkit Developers Snapshot date: Dec 31 2024. You can check eligibility for the airdrop at theVenice token dashboard"
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Venice Compute Unit (VCU)?",
    "answer": "The Venice Compute Unit (VCU) is a unified variable that measures Venice's current inference capacity available on its API per day. It's a way to rationalize the resource of inference across various models and types, such as text vs image, or different model sizes. Think of it as a standardized unit of measurement for the computational power required to run different AI models. For example, 1 VCU might represent the computational power required to run a simple text-based AI model, while 10 VCUs might represent the power required to run a more complex image-based model."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does my daily inference capacity change over time?",
    "answer": "As Venice continues to build out its infrastructure capacity, the total API capacity (measured in VCUs) will tend to rise. This means that your daily inference capacity will increase over time, even if you don't stake more VVV tokens, allowing you to access more computational power and run more complex AI models."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is my daily inference capacity determined?",
    "answer": "Your daily inference capacity is determined by the percentage of staked VVV tokens you hold. VCUs (Venice Compute Units) represent a standardized unit of measurement for the computational power required to run different AI models. For example, if you have 1% of the staked VVV tokens and the total API capacity is 10,000 VCUs, you would be entitled to 100 VCUs (1% of total capacity) every day, without spending or losing your VVV."
  },
  {
    "question": "When are staking rewards paid out?",
    "answer": "Staking rewards accumulate continually and you can withdraw them whenever you wish."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does VVV staking yield work?",
    "answer": "Staking yield is calculated based on the Utilization Rate, which measures the demand for Venice's API capacity. All emissions of the token (14 million VVV per year) are paid either to stakers or to Venice, based on this Utilization Rate. Staking yield is paid out to users in the form of additional VVV tokens. Utilization Rate:‍ This curve incentivizes Venice to keep Utilization Rate as close to 50% as possible, which makes the network robust and adaptable to demand.  If the rate falls toward zero, Venice's incentive is to develop more demand for the API. If the rate rises toward 100%, Venice's incentive is to build more capacity to bring the rate back toward the middle."
  },
  {
    "question": "What determines my inference capacity when staking VVV?",
    "answer": "Inference limits are calculated as a pro-rata share of Venice's growing total capacity, divided across all stakers. As Venice's compute capacity expands, the available inference for each staker will increase proportionally."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the Venice token (VVV) work and what are the benefits of staking it?",
    "answer": "When you stake VVV tokens, you gain access to a pro-rata portion of Venice's total inference capacity via the API on an ongoing basis. This capacity is measured in Venice Compute Units (VCUs), which represent a standardized unit of measurement for the computational power required to run different AI models. By staking VVV, you also benefit from ongoing access to inference at zero-marginal cost, as well as a yield paid to you. This means that AI agents and other API users can access inference capacity without incurring traditional usage fees, while also earning a yield on staked tokens, effectively driving the cost of inference negative."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the tokenomics of the Venice token (VVV)?",
    "answer": "The VVV token has an initial supply of 100 million, allocated as follows: 50% to Venice users and the AI community via airdrop, 35% to Venice.ai for development and growth, 10% to an incentive fund to support ecosystem development, and 5% for liquidity provision. Additionally, 14 million new VVV tokens are emitted annually and awarded to stakers, providing an ongoing incentive for participation in the network. Fundamental demand for the token comes from the utility: by staking VVV a holder obtains access to private and uncensored AI inference at zero cost via the Venice API. This means AI agents, devs, and 3rd party apps can avoid paying per-request fees. If you stake 1% of the Venice token, you get access to 1% of Venice's inference capacity on a continual basis. ‍"
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the supply capped for the Venice token (VVV)?",
    "answer": "From an initial genesis supply of 100m units, 14m are created annually. The inflation rate thus starts at 14% and falls each year. Emissions continue in order to provide ongoing incentive to Venice to continue building the compute capacity of the inference network."
  },
  {

  },
  {
    "question": "How do I generate the same person/face/subject in an image?",
    "answer": "Maintaining the same face on multiple AI-generated images can be tricky, and as the technology continues to improve, and Venice adds more image generation models, this process will become more accurate. In the meantime, this workaround may help you achieve the results you are looking for: ‍ 1. Craft a descriptive prompt that includes the details of the face you want to feature (the more detail, the better - try to include specifics such as hair color, eye shape, facial structure, and any distinguishing features). 2. Select the image icon to switch to image generation mode. 3. Hit the gear icon to open up the image generation settings. 4. Scroll to the bottom of the settings page and click on \"Advanced Settings\", where you'll find the seed value field. Enter a random seed value (e.g., a numerical value like 12345678). 5. Generate your first image using the seed value you've entered. 6. To create variations with the same face, keep the same prompt and change the scene, pose, clothes, or background while using the same seed value. To generate new variations, change the seed value and repeat the process. ‍"
  },
  {
    "question": "Why am I receiving censored responses?",
    "answer": "Within Venice, \"uncensored\" means no additional restrictions have been added to the model's training beyond what's inherent in the base models. But this doesn't mean \"anything goes\", as every model itself has limitations and biases. There is no model which is truly \"unbiased,\" for they are all created by man.The goal isn't to remove all bias (which is impossible), but rather to reduce it and make the remaining bias as transparent as possible. We describe what \"uncensored\" means in Venice in detailin this blog. Venice's master system prompt has been specifically designed to encourage the model to be more open. System prompts are instructions given to the AI model before a conversation begins, shaping how it responds. Experimenting with the Venice system prompts to guide the AI as to how you'd like it to respond to you may further reduce censored responses.This blogdescribes how to use the system prompt to further customize your interactions with Venice."
